# Wildfire Sentinel

Wildfire Sentinel is a React-based web application that displays NASA wildfire data on an interactive OpenStreetMap. The application fetches wildfire event data from NASAâ€™s EONET API (via a custom Express backend) and overlays the events as markers on the map. Each marker provides details about the wildfire event, including title, location, date, and coordinates. A draggable date picker allows users to specify a date range for which the data is displayed.
