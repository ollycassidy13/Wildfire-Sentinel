# Wildfire Sentinel ðŸ”¥

Wildfire Sentinel is a React-based web application that displays NASA wildfire data on an interactive OpenStreetMap. The application fetches wildfire event data from NASAâ€™s EONET API (via a custom Express backend) and overlays the events as markers on the map. Each marker provides details about the wildfire event, including title, location, date, and coordinates. A draggable date picker allows users to specify a date range for which the data is displayed.

## Features

- **Interactive Map:** Uses [react-leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) to display wildfire events on an OpenStreetMap.
- **Custom Markers:** Each wildfire event is represented by a custom marker with a wildfire icon.
- **Event Details:** Clicking a marker opens a popup showing event details like title, location, date, and coordinates.
- **Date Range Picker:** A draggable date picker lets you select the start and end dates to fetch wildfire data.
- **Express API Proxy:** A lightweight Express server fetches data from NASAâ€™s EONET API to avoid CORS issues.
- **Vercel Deployment:** Easily deploy the app on Vercel with separate API and frontend.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ollycassidy13/Wildfire-Sentinel
   cd wildfire-sentinel
   ```

2. **Install dependencies for both client and server:**

   ```bash
   npm run install:all
   ```

   This installs dependencies in both the `client` (React) and `api` (Express) directories.

## Running the Application

### Production Mode (Locally)

To run the application in **production mode** locally:

1. **Build the React app:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Start the Express server and serve the built React app:**

   ```bash
   npm run start:api
   ```

   This serves the React app from the Express server at `http://localhost:3001`.
